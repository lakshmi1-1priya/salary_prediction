## Salary Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts expected salary based on candidate
experience, education, role, and organizational factors.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Project Overview
This project uses supervised machine learning to estimate expected salary
packages. The goal is to support fair, data-driven salary decisions and reduce
human bias in HR processes.

## Model Used
- Random Forest Regressor
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

## Files
- `salary_prediction.ipynb` – Model implementation and analysis
- `expected_ctc.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing

## Outcome
The model successfully identifies key factors influencing salary and provides
reliable predictions based on structured input features.
